## Issues Found:
- Better exception handling, throw exceptions instead of e.printStackTrace();
- In WaTorWorld simulation, magic numbers should be public static final int format
- In the styler, magic numbers should be public static final int format
- In Segregation simulation, control flow statements are nested too deeply

## Priorities:
- Highest priority issues:
    - Throwable.printStackTrace() is a high priority because there are many of them and gives a "fail" message
    - In WaTorWorld simulation, must change the private variables to be public
    - In GridPaneHandler.java, instance methods should not write "static" field
        - Removed static, and removed method to lessen duplicate code
        
## Refactoring Decisions
- Exception handling refactored by throwing exception instead of e.printStackTrace() because it is the responsibility 
of the View to handle it rather than printing out what is wrong
- For private static variables we chose to make them public in order to increase efficiency within our code
- The longest method was in Main.java which sets up the scene and adds all the necessary buttons and grids. We did not refactor
this method as the only reason it is so long is because we are adding so many buttons, however we do not believe that there 
are any code smells. 

## Abstractions
- According to the design checkup, we have 15 classes but only one abstract class. With this information we have decided
to create or consider more abstract classes.
